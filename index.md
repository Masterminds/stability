# Stability Markers

Stability Markers indicate how mature a project is.

> Projects naturally go through stages. Some are experimental and in flux.
> Others enjoy steady contribution toward a clear roadmap. Still others are
> basically finished, needing only the occasional fix. And, as is the nature of
> our business, sometimes software becomes obsolete.

Repositories on GitHub and other places use Stability Markers to let
users know what to expect from a project. Early adopters may be excited
to find new **experimental** projects, while developers concerned with
production usage might instead look for **active** or **sustained**
projects. Finally, it is the nature of software to change, and sometimes
projects become **unmaintained**. The Stability Markers project helps
you inform your users which of these is the case.

## Using Stability Markers

Using a stability marker is as simple as including the relevant badge on
your site. We strongly recommend linking the badge back to our
description so that users unfamiliar with Stability Markers can learn
more.
