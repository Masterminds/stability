# Stability Markers

Stability Markers are convenient labels for your project. They tell your
users how stable and active your particular project is.

There are five stability markers:

- [Experimental](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/experimental.html): Not considered ready for prime-time usage
- [Active](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/active.html): At least one stable release and planned feature releases.
- Sustained: One or more stable releases, mature, and "feature
  complete".
- Maintenance: Stable releases, but only bug fixes planned for the
  future.
- Unmaintained: No longer developed.

See [the main page](https://masterminds.github.io/stability) for more.
