# Stability: Experimental

![Stability: Experimental](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/experimental.svg)

The *Experimental* Stability Marker indicates that this project is still
in flux. Behavior and APIs may not yet be stable, and breaking changes
may occur.


An *Experimental* project has the following characteristics:

- No stable (`>= 1.0.0`) release yet
- Code is in flux
- Breaking changes may occur without warning
- Early adopters welcome
- Because the development cycle for experimental projects is tumultuous,
  sometimes issues and bug reports will be ignored or closed so that
  developers can focus on implementing the core features.
