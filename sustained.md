![Stability: Sustained](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/sustained.svg)

The *Sustained* Stability Marker indicates that this project is
considered feature complete, mature, and ready for production use.

An *Sustained* project has the following characteristics:

- At least one stable release (`>= 1.0.0`)
- Feature complete
- Emphasis may be on maintenance and bug fixing, with few features
- Work on this project may be slow
- Because the project is considered complete and stable, maintainers may
  not be highly active. Expect some delays in the issue queue.

> *TIP:* Because maintainers do not dedicate a lot of time to sustained
> projects, you may need to gently ping them via social media or other
> related projects.
