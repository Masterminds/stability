# Stability: Unmaintained

![Stability: Unmaintained](https://masterminds.github.io/stability/unmaintained.svg)

The *Unmaintained* Stability Marker indicates that this project is no
longer under active development. Importantly, this does not reflect on
the code quality (and is not the same as _deprecated_). It merely means
that there are no outstanding plans to issue another release, and no
individuals are currently taking responsibility for maintenance duty.

An *Unmaintained* project has the following characteristics:

- No future code releases are planned
- There are no maintainers currently dedicating time to the project

> **Tip:** Unmaintained projects are often "looking for a new home". If
> you are interested in continuing to push the project forward, you may
> wish to ask the owners whether they would be interested in help. If
> they are not, this may be an appropriate time to fork a project.
